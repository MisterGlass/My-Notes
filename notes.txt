This is a cheatsheet for common commands, functions, etc I use often.

// search all the contents of a folder and output to a text file. usefull if your forget the location fo a bit fo code in your project.
grep -r searchstring * > output.txt


//most commin git commands
git init
git commit -a -m :update description"
git push origin master
git pull

//more to come...
